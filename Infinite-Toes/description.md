# Problem 3: Infinite-Toes

T. Anderson recently invented a new name called Infinite Tic Tac Toes.

In Infinite Tic Tac Toes, the grid is not a 3x3. Rather, the grid can be any size.

All the other rules from Tic Tac Toe applies to Infinite Tic Tac Toes.

Given a 2D array representing the Infinite Tic Tac Toes grid, determine if there is a winner by returning 'YES' or 'NO'.

Example 1:

[<br>
    &emsp;[ 'X', 'O', ' ' ],<br>
    &emsp;[ ' ', 'X', 'O' ],<br>
    &emsp;[ ' ', 'O', 'X' ]<br>
]
